## ‚ùóÔ∏è EXPERIMENTAL and üõ† HIGHLY UNSTABLE
Please expect major changes in the APIs.

## Ergonomics questions and missing features
- [x] [safe `cuda_printf!` macro](examples/cuda-println/src/lib.rs#L15)
- [ ] proper panic handler (based on `__assertfail` syscall)
- [ ] convinient block and thread accessors (temporary API is here)
- [ ] dynamic memory allocation (based on `malloc` / `free` syscalls)

## Examples
Please checkout examples and play around with `cuda_printf!`.
